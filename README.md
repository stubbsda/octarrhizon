The Octarrhizon project is a program for generating algorithmic music, consisting of roughly 160 lines of C++ code; it relies upon 
the <code>Markov_Chain</code> class from the [Synarmosma library](https://github.com/stubbsda/synarmosma) for an important part of 
its functionality. The program reads its parameters from an XML file, an example of which is contained in <code>parameters.xml</code> 
and for this reason, the software also requires the [PugiXML library](www.pugixml.org) in order to be compiled and linked. The 
Octarrhizon project is released under the Gnu Public License version 3.0; see the <code>LICENSE.txt</code> file or the 
[Free Software Foundation](www.fsf.org/licensing) for details.
